# resolve errors in eclipse
> consider the following factors when resolving errors:
- build all
- the error view
- error icons
> efficient routine:
1. build all. do this before all to make sure the errors are not outdated.
2. check error icons in project explorer. take a glance at the summary of errors.
3. check the problem view. this view is used for `navigating to a specific error` and for `checking details`.
4. resolve errors according to the problem description given in the problem view.
   there are two major error types:
   1. file updating
   2. new files
   both of them can be resolved via `team` -> synchronize with repository
5. build all.
6. check error icons in project explorer. if there is no error icon, all errors are resolved.
