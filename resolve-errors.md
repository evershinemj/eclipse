# resolve errors in eclipse
> consider the following factors when resolving errors:
- build all
- the error view
- error icons
> efficient routine:
1. build all. do this before all to make sure the errors are not outdated.
2. check error icons in project explorer. take a glance at the summary of errors.
3. check the problem view. this view is used for `navigating to a specific error` and for `checking details`.
4. resolve errors according to the problem description given in the problem view.
5. build all.
6. check error icons in project explorer. if there is no error icon, all errors are resolved.
