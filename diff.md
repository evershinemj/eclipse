# major diffs and minor diffs
- **major diffs** are represented by two *horizontal bars*.
- **minor diffs** are within **major diffs**.
- **major diffs** can be navigated by *highlighted* up and down arrows.
- **minor diffs** can be navigated by *non-highlighted* up and down arrows.

# three modes of major diff rendering
- line versus gray patch(add)
- gray patch versus line(delete)
- gray patch versus gray patch(modified)

# minor diff rendering
minor diff is rendered with darker gray

# highlight current diff with blue
one major feature of eclipse diff is that it highlights current diff with blue, regardless of major diff or minor diff

# on clicking current modified diff
on clicking current modified diff, the unmodified chunks turn white, making the modified chunks(darker gray parts) stand out more obviously
