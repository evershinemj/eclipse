# various types of annotatons
## TODO
eclipse has good support for `TODO comments`.
- on the right of the right-handside scrollbar, `TODO comments` are annotated with **blue marks**. clicking these blue marks jumps to corresponding `TODO comments`. 
- to use **ctrl+**,(mnemonic: ctrl+<) and **ctrl+.**(mnemonic: ctrl+>) to jump to these TODO marks, click either the `next annotation` or the `previous annotation`(they are synchronized), and check `task`.
