# team synchronizing
## scenarios
1. right click on a file, then choose `team -> synchronize with repository`.
   it works just like **diff**. hence it can be substituted with **diff**. 
   this is not quite useful(in the sense that it is a substitute, not the 
   operation itself).
1. right click on a folder, then choose `team -> synchronize with repository`.
   this is quite useful, as it shows the status of all files in the folder.
